                    /* 
                    For the following two sections, I made another addtional grouping to make it easier to change to the types and textQueries.

                        Note: For both cases, I checked to see if I have an api value. 
                        As mentioned before, the tuple turns into a string so it is in this format: #,textValue (where # is the grouping number)
                        So I have [4, "Outdoors Vehicles Store"], it converts to "4,Outdoors Vehicles Store".
                        I then call this 
                        if (apiValue.length > 1) 
                            temp = apiValue.split(',')[1].toLowerCase();
                        This means that if the string is more than 1 in length, there should be a value next to it. So I get the value by calling split function and making an array that holds the number and textValue seperate.
                        In this case, it would be ["4", "Outdoors Vehicles Store"]. So temp would be outdoors vehicles store. The other code after is just formatting for api call


                        For Case 1 (types changing), the grouping is as follows:
                            0: If we see a 0, that means we should not make any changes to existing object
                            1: This means we want to just concatenate the incoming values to the beginning of both types and textQuery if applicable (the types might be null, so we just set the types to be incoming)
                            2: This means we want to concatenate the incoming value to the types, but then change the textQuery to be the same as newly created type
                            3: This means we want to completely replace the existing types and textQuery properties with the incoming values
                            4: This means we do not want to mess with the existing type value, but want to make completely change the textQuery
                            5: This means we want to completely replace the types with incoming value, but concatenate to the textQuery

                        Example:
                        Say we are in following question: ["What type of food store are you looking for?", 1]
                        And user selects this answer: ["Food Store", "Price", [2, "Food"]]
                               Think of it like this: [What user sees, Map Key, [#, apiTextValue]]
                        The existing type property is "store" and textQuery is "Food Retail Stores"
                        Here we go to case 1 and then subgrouping 2.
                        Since the subgrouping is 2, that means the we would need to add to existing type. Using the same approach as above for api value,
                        the new type should be "food_store". The textQuery would then be replaced with the newly created type, without the '_'
                        Therefore, the textQuery would be 'food store' (does not matter if lowercase or uppercase, Google would still search either)


                        For Case 2 (textQuery), the grouping is as follows:
                            0 or "": Same as before, don't change anything
                            1: We only want to replace the types property. Majority of the time it is null
                            2: This only concatenate the incoming value with the existing textQuery if applicable
                            3: This changes both the types and textQuery. We completely replace the types with incoming value and then set the textQuery with the newly changed type.
